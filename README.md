# Tic-Tac-Toe
This project is a simple Tic Tac Toe game using React.js. The game is played on a 3x3 grid, and two players will take turns marking their respective symbols ("X" and "O") on the board. The first player to get three of their symbols in a row, column, or diagonal wins the game. If the board is filled without a winner, the game ends in a draw.

Technologies Used:

React: For building the user interface and handling the game's logic in a component-based architecture.
JavaScript: For implementing the game's functionality and rules.
